SUMMARY
-------

Spree is a complete open source commerce solution for Ruby on Rails.  It was originally developed by Sean Schofield
and is now maintained by a dedicated [core team](http://spreecommerce.com/core-team).  You can find out more about
by visiting the [Spree e-commerce project page](http://spreecommerce.com).

Spree actually consists of several different gems, each of which are maintained in a single repository and documented
in a single set of [online documentation](http://spreecommerce.com/documentation).  By requiring the Spree gem you
automatically require all of the necessary dependency gems.  Those gems are as follows:

* spree_api
* spree_auth
* spree_core
* spree_dash
* spree_promo
* spree_sample

All of the gems are designed to work together to provide a fully functional e-commerce platform.  It is also possible,
however, to use only the pieces you are interested in.  So for example, you could use just the barebones spree\_core gem
and perhaps combine it with your own custom authorization scheme instead of using spree_auth.

Using the Gem
-------------

Start by adding the gem to your existing Rails 3.x application's Gemfile

    gem 'spree'

Update your bundle

    bundle install

Then use the install generator to do the basic setup (add Spree to Gemfile, etc.)

    rails g spree:site

Now its time to install all of the necessary migrations, assets, etc.

    rake spree:install

If you'd like to also install sample data and images you can follow up the above command with:

    rake spree_sample:install

Now you just need to run the new migrations

    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

If you also want some sample products, orders, etc. to play with you can run the appropriate rake task.

    rake db:sample

Working with the edge source (latest and greatest features)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The source code is essentially a collection of gems.  Spree is meant to be run within the context of Rails application.  You can easily create a sandbox application inside of your cloned source directory for testing purposes.


1. Clone the git repo

        git clone git://github.com/spree/spree.git spree
        cd spree

2. Install the gem dependencies

        bundle install

3. Create a sandbox rails application for testing purposes (and automatically perform all necessary database setup)

        rake sandbox

6. Start the server

        cd sandbox
        rails server

Running Tests
-------------

If you want to run all the tests across all the gems then

    $ cd spree
    $ rake spec     #=> 'this will run spec tests for all the gems'
    $ rake cucumber #=> 'this will run cucumber tests for all the gems'
    $ rake          #=> 'this will run both spec and cucumber tests for all the gems'

Each gem contains its own series of tests, and for each directory, you need to do a quick one-time
creation of a test application and then you can use it to run the tests.  For example, to run the
tests for the core project.

    $ cd core
    $ rake test_app
    $ rake spec
    $ rake cucumber
    $ rake          #=> 'this will run both spec and cucumber tests for the gem'

    # If you want to run specs for only a single spec file
    $ bundle exec rspec spec/models/state_spec.rb

    # If you want to run a particular line of spec
    $ bundle exec rspec spec/models/state_spec.rb:7

    # If you want to run a single cucumber feature
    # bundle exec cucumber features/admin/orders.feature --require features

    # If you want to run a particular scenario then include the line number
    # bundle exec cucumber features/admin/orders.feature:3 --require features
